# React Search Bar Autocomplete App

This React application provides a simple yet functional search bar that closely resembles the search bar on the SNCF website. It was built using Vite and TypeScript.
## Features

- Autocomplete suggestions based on user input
- Arrow key navigation through the list of suggestions
- Selection of city from the list with the mouse or keyboard
- Display of search results after selecting a city
- Focus and overlay behavior for an enhanced user experience

## Installation and Running the App

To install and run the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-search-bar-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd react-search-bar-app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

- Improve the search experience, especially when modifying the city for the second time and displaying the results
- Optimize performance and scalability through techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and optimizing API calls
- Implement caching strategies for better response times
- Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Monitor user engagement and error tracking through tools like Google Analytics, Sentry, or LogRocket
